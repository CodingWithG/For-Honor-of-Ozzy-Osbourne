# For-Honor-of-Ozzy-Osbourne
This is the most emotional, sudden and the best planned project of all of my entire projects. Yesterday, when I heared Ozzy's death news from social media, I get touched and I want to make a project for honor of him and his passing away as a passioned guitarist, a rock/heavy metal addictor and also, programmer.
