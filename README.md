# For-Honor-of-Ozzy-Osbourne
This is the most emotional, sudden and the best planned project of all of my entire projects. Yesterday, when I heared Ozzy's death news from social media, I get touched and I want to make a project for honor of him and his passing away as a passioned guitarist, a rock/heavy metal addictor and also, a programmer. 
I made a keyframe flame animaton for the candles I designed for this project and also, I used audio element for playing the music: "Mama, I'm Coming Home" , because of it's the most emotional music at his last Back to the Beginning concert. If I get insipred and touched, I'll change some of the design at future but now, I'm get focused to my upcoming big project which I'm planning to launch it for upcoming months(the projects is the most complex so I'll launch the demo version first) and I'm let this project at this version for a long time(during the development, I'd added some blowing out the candle effect but I'm changed my mind because I wanted to leave a light and stay lighted forever at these columns of codes.)
It's an honor to listen your songs, thanks for everything that you made, rest in peace Ozzy, we will never forget you...
